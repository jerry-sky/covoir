## Purpose

This repository contains the solution for the *Nokia Front-end Trainee Summer Trainee* recruitment task.

> Please create a simple Angular 11 application that displays Covid-19 statistics.
> The application should use a free public API to gather data
> (e.g. <https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/covid-193>).
> Let user filter and sort data — it’s up to you in what way.

---

## Solution

The solution consists of an Angular web application and a simple API middleware,
that serves as a mediator between the Angular application and the COVID-19 statistics API.
